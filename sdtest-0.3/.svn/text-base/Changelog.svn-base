Scsi Disk Test for Linux

2008-06-11 Version 0.3-pre3
        made test pattern option.
	modified the process.c, for the 'selfd' test should also be tested
	once for every device out of the main loop.
        modified to use 'off_t' instead of 'size_t' as type of disk size.
	modified 'interf' test by using smaller buffer size to fit various
	types of hard drives.
	fixed a bug in process.c, test string should be preset for every
	process during its intialization.

2008-03-20 Version 0.2
	added codes do 'diskstats' calculating.
	redefined quiet mode option 'nopro', removed 'algo_srb'.
	fixed a bug to get device size before part_test_device.
	fixed a bug in doing checksum of interf buffer test, use only 512k
	to test buffer write read although it is much less than the full
	capacity of real device buffer.
	refined the codes of 'sd_getbs' and 'sd_getsize' according to
	different device types. rewrote the 'sd_get' accordingly so that 
	the /dev/sg can also be supported.
	modified the process.c, for the 'interf' test should only be tested
	once for every device out of the main loop.
	added 'bsget' and 'blkget' hooks in the sd device structure, and
	accordingly moved io method dependent 'bsget' and 'blkget' functions 
	out into their io modules.

2008-03-03 Version 0.1
	made initial version.
